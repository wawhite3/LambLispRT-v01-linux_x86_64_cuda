  //! THE INTERNAL-DRAM THRESHOLD FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT IS SET HERE, AND IT IS 1 KB.  Every

  //! resolves to `heap_caps_malloc_default()`, which consults this one static and TRIES PSRAM
  //! FIRST only for sizes STRICTLY GREATER than the limit.  At or below it, internal DRAM first.
  //!
  //! **DO NOT QUOTE `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL` AS THE THRESHOLD.**  That symbol is
  //! only the value the IDF installs at boot: `esp_psram.c` calls
  //! `heap_caps_malloc_extmem_enable(CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL)` under
  //! `#if CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC` while bringing PSRAM up.  The Arduino sdkconfig sets it to
  //! 4096.  THIS CALL RUNS LATER AND OVERWRITES IT WITH 1024 -- the same static, last writer
  //! wins -- on EVERY ESP32 env, since it is inside the file-wide `#if LL_ESP32`, reached from
  //! `LambPlatform::begin()`, with no per-part guard: S3, classic WROVER and RISC-V C5 alike.
  //! Three comments in this tree quoted 4096 and were wrong by 4x for months, each written by
  //! someone who read the config and never found this line.  They now point here rather than
  //! carry their own copy; if you change the argument, this block is the one place to change.
  //!
  //! WHY 1 KB, WHICH THE ORIGINAL `//1k, why?` DID NOT SAY.  `git blame` returns the ROOT commit
  //! (60bba20f, 2026-01-01) -- the line is older than this repository and has no recorded
  //! rationale.  But the DIRECTION answers it: lowering the limit moves the 1 KB - 4 KB band OUT
  //! of internal DRAM and into PSRAM, so it BUYS BACK internal DRAM.  That is the only account
  //! this project ever runs dry, and three measurements say so -- [B95] (setup.scm drained
  //! ~115 KB and finished with 1176 bytes free while 1.7 MB of PSRAM sat unused; LittleFS then
  //! failed ESP_ERR_NO_MEM 257, because flash reads bounce through internal DRAM), [P211]
  //! (~1,600 interned symbol names, tens of bytes each, ~17 KB parked below the threshold on a
  //! WROVER that finishes boot with 3,364 bytes free), and [B411] (running it dry is a MUTE BOOT
  //! LOOP, not an error).  So: deduced from the direction of the change and consistent with
  //! everything measured, NOT a rationale anyone wrote down.  Treat it as such.
  //!
  //! IT IS A PREFERENCE, NOT A PIN -- AND THE TREE HAS BEEN OVERSTATING THIS.  After choosing a
  //! pool by size, `heap_caps_malloc_default()` does:
  //!
  //!     if (r==NULL && size > 0) { /* try again while being less picky */
  //!         r = heap_caps_malloc_base(size, MALLOC_CAP_DEFAULT); }
  //!
  //! so a sub-1 KB allocation LANDS IN PSRAM when internal DRAM is exhausted.  Nothing says
  //! "FORCED" or "pinned", whatever the older comments claim.  The consequence is the nasty one:
  //! internal exhaustion DOES NOT FAIL AT THE MALLOC THAT EXHAUSTED IT.  It degrades silently,
  //! and the error surfaces at some later caller that genuinely needed DMA-capable or
  //! interrupt-safe memory -- a different subsystem, a different stack trace, no mention of the
  //! allocation that actually spent the budget.  Assume this shape before blaming the reporter.
  //!
  //! THE DEFAULT IS "EXTERNAL DISABLED", which is why the call takes a limit at all: the static
  //! initialises to MALLOC_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_ALLOCS (-1), in which state EVERY capability-less
  //! allocation is internal-only at any size.  Enabling PSRAM for `malloc` and setting the
  //! threshold are one operation, so there is no way to say "enable, keep the current limit".
  //!
  //! UNRELATED TO `-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue`, though both are PSRAM and both are ours.  That
  //! flag is the CPU-3.2 silicon erratum workaround for ESP32-classic (LX6) rev < 3 -- a
  //! code-generation filter that suppresses instruction sequences which corrupt external memory.
  //! It changes what the compiler EMITS, not where the allocator PUTS things, and it lives in
  //! `chip_flags` on the two LX6 boards in `w3_pio/boards.json` (see the `_psram_note` there:
  //! it must not return to the shared block, because the S3 toolchain does not have the option).
  //!
  //! THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS: allocate a bulk VM payload with an explicit `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` --
  //! use `ll_payload_alloc_bytes` -- never with `new`/`malloc`.  Sizing something past a
  //! threshold is NOT a way to move it to PSRAM, and for anything allocated with an explicit
  //! capability (the UART rings, lwIP's pools) this threshold does not apply at all.  Lowering
  //! the argument further would push MORE traffic into PSRAM, which is slower and not
  //! DMA-capable; it has never been measured, so it is not a free win either way.
  //!
  //! NOTE THE API IS UNDOCUMENTED UPSTREAM: `heap_caps_malloc_extmem_enable` appears in
  //! `esp_heap_caps.h` and in `heap_caps.c`, and NOWHERE in the ESP-IDF programming guide's
  //! external-RAM or heap chapters.  Read the implementation, not the docs -- there are none.
