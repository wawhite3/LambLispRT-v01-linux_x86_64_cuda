    immediately, so any constructor's work is discarded, and the destructor path finalizes cells by
    hand before releasing.  Cell has no user-declared destructor, no virtuals and POD members only,
    so `delete[]` was running nothing per element; this is behaviour-preserving.
    NOTHROW BECAUSE THE MCU ARM CANNOT THROW: `heap_caps_malloc` returns null, so a caller that
    handles both must get a null here too.  Previously `new Cell[]` threw and the collector's OOM
    bail was unreachable on this target -- the two arms disagreed about the contract. */
