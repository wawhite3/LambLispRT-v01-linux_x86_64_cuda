    WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT REPLACED A PROBE BUILT ON `tone`.  Measuring whether a board
    is still USABLE after something has eaten its internal memory needs an instrument with two
    properties, and a driver's init call has neither:

    * IT MUST BE REPEATABLE.  `tone()` reaches `tone_init()`, which creates a FreeRTOS queue ONCE.
      After the first successful call it can never fail again, whatever the memory state -- so an
      instrument built on it reports "fine" forever.  Measured on a classic ESP32:
      a mass NCG pass drove internal free from 26,532 B to 628 B and the tone probe still reported
      ZERO failures.  A ONE-SHOT INITIALISER CANNOT BE A REPEATABLE PROBE.
    * IT MUST NAME THE RESOURCE THAT ACTUALLY STARVES.  DMA-capable is STRICTER than internal, and
      it is what a camera, an I2S ring or a queue needs.  Internal headroom can look adequate while
      every DMA request refuses.

    AND LARGEST, NOT FREE, for the reason `ncg_exec_pool_init()` already records: free is not the
    number that decides a CONTIGUOUS request.  It once printed `INTERNAL free=85448` to explain a
    refusal whose real blocker was a 14,324-byte largest block.  Read this beside
    `Platform.free-dma`, never instead of it -- the pair distinguishes exhaustion from
    fragmentation, and they need different fixes. */

    where no filesystem is mounted, so "no filesystem" is distinguishable from "full filesystem".

    WHY AN APPLICATION SHOULD READ THESE BEFORE A SUSTAINED WRITE.  Flash write latency is not flat:
    it rises sharply as the filesystem fills, because the allocator has to work harder to find and
    erase space.  Measured on an ESP32-S3 with a 128-block partition, one chunked file transfer:
    76.7 ms per chunk round trip with the filesystem clean, and 1,211 ms per chunk with ~82 KB of
    other files present -- about sixteen times slower, appearing when those files are added and
    disappearing when they are removed.  The writes still succeed and their checksums still match,
    so nothing fails and nothing warns; a program with a deadline simply starts missing it, and the
    delay looks like it came from somewhere else entirely.

    So a program that must meet a deadline while writing should check free space first and degrade
    deliberately -- write less, write elsewhere, or decline -- rather than discover the cost. */

/*! (Platform.root-depth) and (Platform.root-depth-max) -- how much of the GC root stack is in use
    now, and the deepest it has ever been.  (Platform.root-depth-max!) re-baselines the peak to the
    current depth so one piece of work can be measured on its own.

    WHAT THE ROOT STACK IS, IN ONE SENTENCE: the runtime records there every heap value it is
    holding on behalf of code that is mid-execution, so the collector cannot reclaim something still
    in use.  Its capacity is fixed at build time, and exhausting it raises a catchable error rather
    than corrupting anything -- so this pair is a capacity-planning instrument, not a fault detector.

    READ THEM AS A PAIR, AND PREFER THE PEAK.  The instantaneous depth is whatever happens to be
    held at the moment you ask, which on an idle REPL is near nothing; it cannot tell you what a
    workload DID.  Two very different programs look identical in a single reading -- one that nests
    procedure calls deeply, and one that iterates a long loop accumulating held values -- and they
    have opposite remedies.  The peak distinguishes them: deep nesting is bounded by how far the
    program recurses, while a loop's peak grows with its ITERATION COUNT, so a peak that scales with
    the size of the input names a loop.

    HOW TO USE IT.  Call (Platform.root-depth-max!) immediately before the work and
    (Platform.root-depth-max) immediately after; the difference is that work's demand.  Run it at
    two input sizes.  A figure that stays flat as the input grows is bounded by the program's
    structure and will stay safe on a larger input; one that doubles when the input doubles will not,
    and the input size at which it would exhaust the stack is worth computing before a deployment
    rather than discovering in one.

    THE PEAK IS NOT RESET BY A COLLECTION and does not fall when values are released -- it is a
    high-water mark, deliberately, because the number that matters for capacity is the worst moment
    the program has ever reached and not the comfortable one it is in now. */

    separate -- a long computation keeps allocating and a stalled one does not.  Sampling this
    value, waiting, and sampling again therefore distinguishes SLOW from STOPPED, which no timer
    can do on its own.

    HOW TO USE IT.  Compare two samples for equality and nothing else: the value is an opaque
    token, not a count, and it wraps.  Sample it from a timer, a supervisory task or a monitoring
    loop -- never from the computation being watched, which is the thing that may be stuck.

    READING IT ALLOCATES, so two consecutive reads differ by a few counts even with nothing in
    between.  Compare the SIZE of a delta against a known-idle baseline, not its mere presence: a
    delta of a handful means nothing happened, a delta of thousands means work is being done. */

    Starts a low-priority sampler that reads the progress token every POLL-MS milliseconds (100 by
    default, floored at 10) and prints one line if the evaluator has not allocated for MS
    milliseconds.  POLL-MS is the RESOLUTION of the margin that `Platform.progress-watch-stats`
    reports, not merely a cost: a gap shorter than one poll cannot be seen at all.  **It never resets or interrupts anything.**
    Returns #t if a sampler started, #f if one was already running, if the task could not be created,
    or on a platform where sampling is not provided.

    WHAT IT IS FOR.  A deadline-driven program cannot tell a long computation from a stuck one by
    watching the clock, and neither can an operator watching a serial port.  This reports the
    difference: one line, naming how long the evaluator was quiet, with no effect on the program.
    Leave it running during a long soak and read what the worst legitimate quiet period actually is
    -- that measurement is what makes any later automatic recovery safe to set, and guessing it is
    how a watchdog ends up restarting healthy work.

    MS IS FLOORED AT 100.  Below that it measures its own sampling noise rather than the program.

    READ ALL THREE OR NONE.  `max-quiet-ms` is the longest interval the evaluator went without

    THE ACTUATORS ARE LEFT WHERE THE RESET LEAVES THEM.  That is a deliberate decision, not an

    were, which is the expensive direction.  Measured on an S3: a real workload's worst quiet period
    is 330-385 ms during STARTUP and 10-30 ms once running, so arming after the application has

//! cable attached.  Resetting to find out defeats the purpose.
//!
//! IT IS THE ONE OBSERVABLE NO TOOL IN THE CHAIN CAN FABRICATE.  The binary reports its own
//! identity, so a verb cannot claim a successful update by exiting 0 -- and several verbs in this
//! toolset have been found doing exactly that.  A changed stamp is proof the image
//! changed; an unchanged stamp is proof it did not, whatever anything else reported.
//!
//! NOTE it dates the BUILD, not the source: a dirty tree produces a binary that is no commit at
//! all (see the header of `src/w3_build.h`).  Use it to answer "is this a different binary than
//! before", which is a question it answers exactly, and never "which commit is this".

 *
 *  ONE list, two consumers -- see the declaration in `ll_platform_generic.h` for why.
 *
 *  Only MECHANICALLY DERIVABLE identifiers belong here: the implementation, the platform, the CPU
 *  and the byte order, each read from a compile-time macro so it cannot disagree with the binary
 *  it is compiled into.  A feature that asserts a LANGUAGE property -- `full-unicode`,
 *  `exact-closed`, `ratios` -- is a promise about behaviour and is added only once something
 *  tests that the promise holds.  Claiming one that is only PARTLY true is worse than omitting
 *  it: a program guarding on it takes the wrong branch and says nothing, whereas a missing
 *  feature makes it take the conservative branch.  `full-unicode` is the live example -- the
 *  reader and writer handle every codepoint to U+10FFFF, but `char-upcase` and friends cover
 *  ASCII and Latin-1 only, so the feature is NOT reported.

      //! comparison held and the suite reported depth boundedness as PROVEN on a board while
      //! measuring nothing.  A degenerate pass is worse than a failure: it is indistinguishable from
      //! a real result and it removes the reason to look again.  Caught before it ran on hardware.
