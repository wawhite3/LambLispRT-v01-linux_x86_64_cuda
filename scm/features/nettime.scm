;;; nettime.scm -- SNTP client (RFC 4330) over UDP.  B402.
;;;
;;; WHY THIS EXISTS.  B170 made TLS check the peer certificate's validity window in our own code,
;;; because the prebuilt Arduino mbedTLS has CONFIG_MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE unset and therefore
;;; accepts EXPIRED certificates.  That check fails closed below 2020-01-01, and an ESP32 has no
;;; battery-backed RTC -- so without a time source `net/tls-connect` can never pass.  This is the
;;; time source.
;;;
;;; THIS IS SNTP, NOT NTP, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT PEDANTRY.  RFC 4330 is the single-shot
;;; subset: one request, one reply, use the answer.  It does NOT discipline the clock, keep a
;;; frequency estimate, filter across polls, or reject a falseticker by voting.  For "get the
;;; clock above 2020 so certificates can be checked" that is exactly right.  For anything where
;;; the time itself is the measurement, it is not.
;;;
;;; An earlier draft of this file used RFC 868 over TCP/37 because LambLisp had no UDP primitive.
;;; It now has one (B404: open-udp-port / udp-send / udp-recv), so this is the real protocol.

;;; THE NAVY SERVERS.  tick and tock are the US Naval Observatory's public NTP service; USNO is
;;; the DoD time standard and one of the two realisations of UTC in the US (UTC(USNO), alongside
;;; UTC(NIST)).  Addresses are literals because this build has no resolver primitive exposed to
;;; Scheme -- `udp-send` takes whatever string it is handed, and on the ESP32 that string goes to
;;; the lwIP resolver, but a literal removes DNS as a failure mode on a bench with no DNS.
;;;
;;; NIST is listed third ON PURPOSE: it is a different operator, a different clock ensemble and a
;;; different network path, so a fault that takes out both USNO addresses at once -- a route, a
;;; firewall rule, a decommissioning -- does not take the capability with it.
