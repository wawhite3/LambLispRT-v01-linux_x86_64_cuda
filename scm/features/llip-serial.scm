;;; llip-serial.scm -- LOOP-BASED, NON-BLOCKING LLIP receiver over the serial REPL.
;;;
;;; This is NOT a blocking loop.  The frame verbs (op/da/cl) are plain top-level functions
;;; that the normal REPL -- itself non-blocking and loop-based (it assembles a line across
;;; main-loop ticks and evaluates it when complete) -- evaluates ONE LINE AT A TIME.  Nothing
;;; blocks: the main loop keeps ticking Sonar/Led/Buzzer/etc between frames.
;;;
;;; Combined with P132 quiet mode ((llt) = quiet on, (en) = quiet off), the console emits no
;;; per-char echo and no input-form echo (quiet gates BOTH the terminal redisplay and the loop's
;;; "Input: <form>" log), so a host tool sends one frame line, reads one ACK line, and moves on --
;;; literal sentinels are safe (the marker is no longer echoed back in the input).  The REPL's own
;;; "Output: <value>" print is NOT suppressed (a driver may want to read results), but it prints
;;; AFTER each frame's ACK/each form's own output, so it never confuses the host.
;;;
;;; Wire protocol (host -> REPL; each line is a normal eval; reply one line each):
;;;   (llt)                   quiet mode ON   -- silence echo + async flood while tunneling
;;;   (op "path")             open+truncate, reset seq/counters      -> ACK
;;;   (da SEQ CRC "chunk")    CRC ok & SEQ==expected -> write          -> ACK SEQ  (else NAK exp)
;;;   (cl)                    close; report chars + aggregate cksum    -> DONE N FC
;;;   (en)                    quiet mode OFF  -- back to interactive
;;;   <any other s-expr>      evaluated normally; in quiet mode only its own (display ...) output
;;;                           streams -- this is how a host RUNS a command (e.g. a test runner).
;;; Stop-and-wait ARQ: per-frame Fletcher-16 (ck) + sequence number; the host retransmits on
;;; NAK/timeout.  This is the reliability LLIP gets free from TCP but must supply over raw serial.

;;; ---- [P132] THE PULL DIRECTION: sf/sd/sc, the mirror of op/da/cl -----------------------------
;;;
;;; WHY IT EXISTS: `llip recv` has never worked.  The host CLI exits with
;;; "recv needs the device-side pull primitive (llip-send-file); not present in this firmware yet",
;;; so there has been no way to read a file OFF a board -- which is why answering "what settings does
;;; this board actually hold?" required flashing it and inferring, and why a truncated push [B585] had
;;; to be diagnosed from a 21 ms load time instead of by reading what arrived.
;;;
;;; SAME SHAPE AS THE PUSH, deliberately: one open, N chunks each with a sequence number and a
;;; Fletcher-16 over the bytes ON THE WIRE, then a close reporting totals the host can check
;;; end-to-end.  `ck` is the same function `da` verifies with, and the host already has it as
;;; `fletcher16`, so neither side needs new arithmetic.
;;;
;;; CHUNKS ARE HEX, AND THAT IS A V1 CHOICE WITH A REASON.  It doubles the bytes on the wire, which
;;; for pulling a settings file or a log is irrelevant, and it buys two things a quoted string cannot:
;;; nothing needs escaping (a Scheme string on the wire would need the device to escape and the host to
;;; unescape, a second parser to get wrong), and a NUL is just "00" -- a LambLisp string cannot hold one
;;; at all, it SHORTENS the object (B317), which is the same reason the push needed a separate binary
;;; frame.  So this one path pulls text and binary alike.  If the 2x ever matters, base64.scm is present
;;; and the framing does not change.

;;!The host re-requests the same chunk simply by not advancing; a chunk whose ck disagrees is a
;;!re-request, so `sd` is idempotent only in the sense `da` is -- the seq number is the contract.
;;!READ BYTES, NEVER CHARACTERS.  `read-char` on a LambLisp port DECODES UTF-8 -- it wraps
;;!`read_codepoint` -- so one call consumes 1-4 BYTES and yields one codepoint, while `llip--hex2`
;;!emits exactly two hex digits, i.e. one byte.  Using it here corrupted every binary file that
;;!happened to contain a valid multi-byte sequence:
;;!  * a 2-byte sequence became ONE byte -- silent loss, and the checksum AGREED because it is
;;!    computed over this same stream, so the transfer verified its own corruption;
;;!  * a 3- or 4-byte sequence gave a codepoint above 255, so `(quotient cp 16)` indexed past the
;;!    end of the 16-character hex table and RAISED, which is why a JPEG died at a fixed chunk.
;;!Measured: a 300-byte file with one `C3 A9` at offset 10 pulled as 299 bytes with `e9` there, and
;;!reported "299/299 bytes, cksum 48805/48805".  A file of `0xFF` of ANY size was always fine,
;;!because 0xFF can never be a UTF-8 lead byte -- which is what showed the variable is CONTENT and

;;; ---- [P132] sec.6.2: the BINARY CHUNK FRAME (`db`) -----------------------------------------
;;;
;;; WHY op/da/cl IS NOT ENOUGH.  `da` carries its payload as a STRING, and a LambLisp string
;;; cannot hold a NUL at all -- writing one does not set a byte, it SHORTENS the object (B317).
;;; A VM `.bin`, a bytevector, a JPEG: all contain NUL, so none can ride the text frame.  `db`
;;; carries RAW BYTES on the wire with no escaping and no base64, which is also why it costs
;;; nothing in size.
;;;
;;; THE HEADER IS AN ORDINARY EVAL.  `(db SEQ LEN CRC)` is a legal s-expression, so the SAME
;;; non-blocking REPL that handles op/da/cl handles it -- there is no mode switch at the parser.
;;; Evaluating it only ARMS the receiver; it does not read the payload.
;;;
;;; THE PAYLOAD IS DRAINED BY A TICK, NOT BY A BLOCKING READ.  `db-tick!` takes whatever bytes are
;;; available right now and returns, so the main loop keeps servicing Sonar/Led/Buzzer and the
;;; collector between chunks.  That is the whole reason `read-bytevector-avail!` had to exist:
;;; `read-bytevector!` loops on read_u8, which is non-blocking on serial but SPINS on TCP, so its
;;; behaviour depends on the transport the caller happens to be using.
;;;
;;; WHILE ARMED, THE LINE ASSEMBLER MUST NOT TOUCH THE UART.  `(llip-db-armed! #t)` tells the
;;; terminal layer to step aside (ll_vm_term.cpp).  A `\n` inside the payload is then just a data
;;; byte counted against LEN, not a line terminator.  DISARMING IS NOT OPTIONAL: a stuck flag is a
;;; console that looks alive and answers nothing, so every exit path below clears it.
