;;;
;;; WHY THIS IS NOT BASE64.  P123 C1 fixes the control wire as newline-delimited s-expressions
;;; and says "no new codec".  A JPEG is binary, so an earlier draft proposed base64 to stay
;;; inside that rule -- unnecessary, because LambLisp ports are ALREADY binary: binary-port?
;;; returns #t for every port (ll_vm_mop3_port.cpp:863) and read-bytevector / write-bytevector /
;;; read-u8 / write-u8 / u8-ready? are all registered.  So a frame rides the SAME TCP port the
;;; move programs use, unencoded.  Measured on the S3-EYE 2026-09-17: a 240x240 frame is 4954
;;; bytes; base64 would have spent 6605 to carry it.
;;;
;;; THE WIRE.  One s-expression header line, then exactly LEN raw bytes with NO trailing newline:
;;;
;;;     (vision-frame SEQ LEN FMT)\n<LEN bytes>
;;;
;;; The header is still read by `read`, so a human or the orchestrator sees ordinary LLIP traffic
;;; and C1's discipline is preserved for everything that is not the payload itself.
;;;
;;; DO NOT send frames through llip-server.scm's read/write file ops.  That path transfers content
;;; as a Scheme STRING LITERAL and its own header (scm/tools/llip-server.scm:145) warns that NUL
;;; bytes may truncate.  A JPEG is full of NULs.  This file exists so that path is never reached for.
;;;
;;; Deps: read-line / read-bytevector! / write-bytevector / write / flush-output-port (C++);
;;;       camera-capture + camera-init only for the capture helpers, which are optional -- the
;;;       codec itself loads and runs on a board with no camera at all, and on Linux.

;;; --- capability probe ----------------------------------------------------------
;;; #t only where a camera driver is actually compiled in.  Guarded, because on a target without
;;; LL_CAMERA the name is unbound and a bare reference would raise at load time rather than
;;; letting the caller choose what to do.

;;; --- receive -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Read exactly n bytes, looping over short reads.  A SOCKET MAY RETURN FEWER BYTES THAN ASKED
;;; -- a TCP segment boundary lands wherever it lands -- so a single read-bytevector! is wrong
;;; here even though it works every time on a local pipe.  Returns the bytevector, or #f on EOF
;;; before n bytes arrived (a truncated frame is never silently short: the caller must see #f).
;;; [P228] THE THREE ANSWERS.  `read-bytevector!` distinguishes them, and this loop must too:
;;;   (eof-object? r)  the peer closed mid-frame  -> the frame is truncated, give up
;;;   r = 0            open, nothing arrived YET  -> NOT an error; yield and ask again
;;;   r > 0            progress
;;; Treating 0 as failure is exactly the bug [B490] was: a frame merely in flight read as a dead
;;; stream, and 20,000 delivered bytes were discarded on the first call.  The retry budget is what
;;; keeps "not yet" from becoming "never" -- a peer that stops sending must end this loop, and
;;; `u8-ready?` is the probe that tells the two apart without spinning.
(define llip-vision-read-stall-limit 400)      ;;; ~400 * 5 ms = 2 s of silence before giving up

;;; THE STALL LIMIT IS NOT A TIME BOUND, AND CALLERS IN A COOPERATIVE LOOP NEED ONE.
;;; `((> r 0) (loop (+ got r) 0))` resets the counter on ANY progress, deliberately -- that is what
;;; makes "not yet" different from "never" ([B490]).  But it means the limit bounds SILENCE, not
;;; duration: a peer dribbling one byte every 4 ms never trips it and holds this procedure for as
;;; long as it stays alive.  That is the same shape [B488] fixed on the WRITE side of this codec --
;;; a deadline that progress can reset is not a deadline.
;;;
;;; DEADLINE is therefore OPTIONAL and absent means exactly the old behaviour, so a caller that is
;;; not inside a tick budget (a host tool, a one-shot capture) is unaffected.  Pass an absolute
;;; `(millis)`-based deadline from a cooperative loop.
;;; A caller that DOES bound this must treat a #f as leaving the stream DESYNCHRONISED: the header
;;; has been consumed and some of the body with it, so the connection cannot be reused for framing.

;;; WHY THIS IS ON THE DEVICE AND NOT A LOOP ON THE HOST.  Driving this from the workstation costs a

;;; so a 25-point sweep took minutes and the operator could not see one setting next to another.
;;; Here the whole sweep is one call and the panel updates at the dwell rate, which is the only way
;;; a human can actually compare settings.  It also keeps ONE connection for the whole sweep: the
;;; panel's receiver frees its slot on EOF, so reconnecting per frame re-enters the accept race
;;; ([B646]) for no reason.
;;;
;;; DWELL IS FOR THE OPERATOR'S EYE, NOT THE LINK -- default 1200 ms, long enough to look at.  The
;;; camera needs a frame or two to settle after a sensor write, which is why the capture happens
;;; AFTER the dwell rather than immediately: setting brightness and grabbing in the same breath
;;; returns the PREVIOUS exposure, and that reads as "the control does nothing".  Measured
