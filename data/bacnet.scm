;;;
;;; WHAT THIS IS, IN THE VOCABULARY A SPECIFICATION WILL ASK IN.  BACnet does not divide the world
;;; into client and server boxes; it assigns a role PER SERVICE, where **A** originates a confirmed
;;; request and **B** executes it and answers.  Conformance is stated as BIBBs (BACnet
;;; Interoperability Building Blocks).  This node has a Device object and both sides of discovery:
;;;
;;;     bacnet-who-is          DM-DDB-A   sends Who-Is, collects I-Am           (initiator)
;;;     bacnet-read-property   DS-RP-A    Data Sharing - ReadProperty           (initiator)
;;;     bacnet-write-property  DS-WP-A    Data Sharing - WriteProperty          (initiator)
;;;     bacnet-device-poll     DM-DDB-B   answers Who-Is with I-Am              (EXECUTES)
;;;     bacnet-device-poll     DS-RP-B    serves ReadProperty on the Device object (EXECUTES)
;;;
;;; SO IT IS DISCOVERABLE AND READABLE: a workstation scanning the network finds it (DM-DDB-B) and
;;; can then read its Device object (DS-RP-B).  That pair is the line between a tool that talks to
;;; BACnet equipment and a node that IS one.
;;;
;;; IT MEETS THE BIBB REQUIREMENTS OF **B-SS** (BACnet Smart Sensor), the smallest standard device
;;; profile -- B-SS requires DS-RP-B and DM-DDB-B, and both are here.  Worded carefully: it MEETS
;;; THE BIBB REQUIREMENTS.  It is not a certified B-SS, because certification is a test-lab
;;; process and a PICS is a document a person signs.
;;;
;;; AND A USEFUL SMART SENSOR NEEDS SENSOR OBJECTS, which this does not have.  The only object is
;;; the Device object, so there is no analog-input whose present-value a workstation could read:
;;; conformant and empty.  Adding input objects is small -- the property store is already a
;;; per-object alist -- and saying so is better than letting "B-SS" imply it.
;;;
;;; STILL ABSENT: ReadPropertyMultiple, COV, alarm and event
;;; handling, segmentation, and MS/TP (BACnet/IP over UDP only).
;;;
;;; DS-WP-B IS NO LONGER ABSENT -- it landed with [P109] Ph1 (2026-09-24) and this line used to name
;;; it here, in a list headed STILL ABSENT, which read as "we cannot be written to".  That is the
;;; wrong way round now and it is a CUSTOMER-VISIBLE claim: all of scm/ ships with every target, so
;;; this comment travels to the public per-target repos.  B-SA and B-ASC still need "more besides"
;;; beyond DS-WP-B, so the profile claim above stays at B-SS -- but the reason is the remainder, not
;;; a missing write path.  See the DS-WP-B section further down for what is implemented.
;;;
;;; THE BIBB NAMES ABOVE ARE FROM ASHRAE 135 Annex K AND ARE NOT MACHINE-CHECKED HERE.  Before any
;;; of them goes into a compliance table or a datasheet, read them against the standard: a
;;; conformance claim is sales surface, and [B388] is this file's own cautionary record of what an
;;; unverified protocol claim costs once it ships to every customer.
;;;
;;; WHY PURE SCHEME AND NOT bacnet-stack.  P109 proposes binding `bacnet-stack`, which is the right
;;; answer for a full device.  For a client this is ~300 lines over the UDP primitive [B404] added,
;;; it ships to every target with `scm/` at zero flash cost on targets that never load it, and it
;;; carries no GPL-with-linking-exception question into a customer's build.  When P109 Ph2+ needs a
;;; device, the library is the right tool; this file is deliberately not in its way.
;;;
;;; ON THE WIRE (Annex J).  Every frame is
;;;     BVLL:  81 <function> <len16>          len counts the WHOLE frame including these 4 bytes
;;;     NPDU:  01 <control>                   control 04 = expecting a reply
;;;     APDU:  the service, tagged per clause 20
;;; Tags: a CONTEXT tag byte is (number<<4) | 8 | length, an APPLICATION tag byte is
;;; (number<<4) | length, and lengths 6 and 7 in a context tag mean OPENING and CLOSING.
;;; That one rule explains every magic byte below: 0x0C is "context 0, 4 bytes" (an object id),
;;; 0x19 is "context 1, 1 byte" (a property id), 0x3E/0x3F are "open/close tag 3".

;;; available to us.  The standard broadcasts I-Am anyway -- every listener wants the binding, not

;;; THE WHOLE OF DM-DDB-B, AND IT IS PURE ON PURPOSE.  Given a device and a received datagram it
;;; returns the frame to broadcast, or #f for "nothing to say".  No socket, so the obligation can
;;; be tested without a network -- which is the only way the range filtering gets exercised at all.

;;; ---- [P109] DS-WP-B: the half that lets something WRITE to us ---------------------------------
;;;
;;; WHY IT COMPLETES A PAIR RATHER THAN ADDING A FEATURE.  DS-RP-B above made this node readable; a
;;; workstation could find it (DM-DDB-B) and interrogate it.  It still could not CHANGE anything, so
;;; every integration was one-way and the file's own "STILL ABSENT" list opened with
;;; "DS-WP-B (nothing can write to us)".  With this, the Device object's properties are writable by
;;; the same peer that can read them, which is what B-SA requires beyond B-SS.
;;;
;;; AN UNKNOWN PROPERTY IS REFUSED, NOT CREATED.  `bacnet-device-set-prop!` returns #f when the
;;; property is not already in the store, and that #f becomes an Error-PDU rather than a new alist
;;; entry.  A device that silently invents a property it was asked to write would answer the NEXT
;;; ReadProperty for it with a value no object model ever declared -- conformant-looking and wrong.
;;; The same reasoning as the array-index refusal in DS-RP-B: answering "I do not have that" is part
;;; of the obligation.
